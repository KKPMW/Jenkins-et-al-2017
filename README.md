# The Germ Line Age Calculator

The following steps are outlined to demonstrate the functionality of
the Germ Line Age Calculator. These steps are to be used with the
Illumina methylation array data sets (450k or EPIC). Specifically, the
steps outlined below assume that beta-values (SWAN normalized) are
available which can be performed with multiple different open source
tools (ChAMP, Minfi, etc.) as well as other software tools (Partek).

Predicted ages are obtained via the call to a `predict_germ_age()` function.

The functoin expects the following arguments:

1. `x` - a numeric matrix of beta values.

```

```

2. `probeID` - a vector of probe IDs for each row of the `x` matrix.

```

"cg00050873" "cg00212031" "cg00213748" "cg00214611" "cg00455876" "cg01707559"

```

3. `batch` - sentrix barcode numbers for each column of the `x` matrix.

```

1888849019, 1888849019, 1888849020, 1888849020, 1888849035, 1888849094
